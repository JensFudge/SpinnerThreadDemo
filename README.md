# SpinnerThreadDemo
This is a demo project with the Animated spinner running while the app gets data in a seperate thread
The demo shows how to get a spinner running on the userinterface while a seperate thread is retreiving data from somewhere 
(actually it's just calling a method that could be getting data, but is just sleeping. Just to show the basics.

There is also in the demo shown how to make a dialog-looking user interface working on Android and iOS, where blocking code is not permitted
